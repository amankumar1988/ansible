# ansible


### INVENTORY : Inventory is nothing but the list of machine ip or dns names that you want ansible to be managed

Ansible by default installs 2.9 as by default on AMI's we will get python2.
Always go with latest version, which can be installed from tools/ansible/install.sh 

all is a group which included all the entries in INVENTORY File

ANSIBLE has lot of pre-defined variables and we need to use them to supply userName and password it has to use to authenticate to the nodes.
 
### ansible_user     : Predefined variable for userName 
### ansible_password : Predefined variable for password  

```
Variables should be passed to ansible by using the flag -e 
    
    Ex: ansible -i INVENTORY all  -e ansible_user=userName -e ansible_password=password 
    $ ansible -i inv all  -e ansible_user=centos -e ansible_password=xyz123 -m shell -a uptime

```

Ansible is a collection of modules / collections : Whatever the task that you want to perform is already predefined, all you need is just to consume them.

There 1000's of modules available : -m shell.  -m yum , -m service


### Ansible can be executed in 2 ways : 

```

1) Manual Approach      : using ansible command  : With this you can execute one command at time.
2) Automated Approach   : using ansible playbook : With this we can mention all the set of tasks that needs to be executed, things will happen in the declared approach 

```

## Automated Approach : This uses Playbook 

```
Playbooks are written using a language called YAML.

YAML is just  markup languaga ; Markup language is nothing a presentation language

```

`YAML` is indendation specific.


### What is a playbook ?

```
* Playbook : A Playbook is a list of plays ( and that's why it always starts with - )
* Play     : A Play is a list of tasks.
* Task     : A Task is nothing but an action that we wish to perform

```

### How to run a playbook ?

```
ansible-playbook -i inventoryFileName -e ansible_user=userName -e ansible_password=password nameOfThePlaybook.yml 

```

### Ansible Facts :

```
Facts are the properties of the remote nodes that you ansible is going to collect ;  Based on these facts collected ansible decides whether to perform the action or not 

How do I know, what all are the facts that are collected by ANSIBLE ?

* Ansible uses a module called as setup using that we can check the collected facts 

    $ ansible -i inventory all -m setup 

```
